# Overview

I chose to create a flutter application of a ToDo app where users can create their ToDos for the day and cross them out after they are done with that ToDo.

The app is very simple to use, the user can add a ToDo by pressing the plus button and cross it out by pressing the box. 

The purpose of creating this app is to make life more organized by creating a list of what a user need to do and cross that task after doing it.

# Development Environment

I used flutter framework for this project. Flutter is an open source framework developed by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications from a single codebase for any web browser, android, iOS, etc.

Libraries I used:
* Hive - Hive is a lightweight and blazing fast key-value database written in pure Dart.
* Hive_flutter - Extension for Hive. Makes it easier to use Hive in Flutter apps.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add a delete option.
* Add a category section where a user can create a category and put their ToDos in each category selected.
* Add an until date where a user will be notified via alarm when the ToDo is almost due.
